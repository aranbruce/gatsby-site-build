              Finding events and activities around you, or for an upcoming
              holiday, can be a drag. No matter the review site, there’s always
              the question of how much you can trust a strangers opinion.
              Wouldn’t it be great if you could see the places recommended
              solely by your friends and wider network? This is the idea behind
              CitySnapp.

              The app is designed to allow users to quickly find activities
              endorsed by people they trust. It then helps them plan what to do
              on which days. It’s social functionality allows users to invite
              their friends to join them, as well as share, review their past
              activities, and follow what their friends and other influencers
              are up to.
