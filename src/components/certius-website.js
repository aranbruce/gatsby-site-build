            Using the proposed page strucutre, the website was wireframed and
            then designed incorporating key commonalities identified during the
            competitor analysis. This included aspects such as a prominent
            company descriptor, engaging visual elements, minimalistic design,
            showcasing of previous work or case studies, and enquiry forms
            displayed on multiple pages.
          </p>

            The final design incorporates abstract shapes contained within the
            logo, whilst using imagery of Iran to convey the companies expertise
            and experience within the country. Key calls-to-action where placed
            throughout each page, inviting users to view Certiusâ€™
            accomplishments and previous work, before making inbound enquires.
