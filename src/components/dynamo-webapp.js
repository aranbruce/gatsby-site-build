                    <p>
                        Dynamo’s ambition was to build a customer-facing digital fact find that trasitioned 
                        smoothly into an advice call with a mortgage expert. Information submitted by 
                        the customer would then be used to brief mortgage experts on a customer’s 
                        circumstances, helping them tailor the advice they gave.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To deliver on this, Dynamo created a web application on the MERN stack (MongoDB, 
                        Express.js, React, Node.js), using a combination of co-located and near-shore 
                        developers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Together, we created a customer journey that was intuitive for our customers, with 
                        the ability for someone to track their application through to completion. It 
                        also synchronised instantly with our bespoke CRM system, allowing our customer 
                        support to instantly understand where someone was in their application.
