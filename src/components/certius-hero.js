            <h5>Identifying Certius’ Key Audiences</h5>
            <p>
              By conducting market research and reviewing Certius’ current
              business model, it became clear that the company had two distinct
              audience segments:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Iranian businesses looking to improve their market access;
              </li>
              <li>
                International businesses looking to enter or grow their presents
                in the Iranian market.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Both of these could then be further broken down by their objective
              when interacting with Certius:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Senior managers and executives looking to assess the credibility
                of Certius as a key business partner as well as understand its
                authority within the Iranian market;
              </li>
              <li>
                C-suite employees looking to determine the feasibility of
                exploiting Iran as an under-utilised market.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
