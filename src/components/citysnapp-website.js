                        Whilst the app was in build, a marketing site was created to test the value proposition 
                        of the product and analyse the most effective language to market to target consumers. 
                        The site also served as a potential lead generation source, with visitors being offered 
                        the option to sign up for early access to the app whilst it was still in build.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To accomplish this, the website needed to clearly and concisely explain the purpose of the app, 
                        its key features, and how it could improve the lives of its potential users. In addition to 
                        this it's calls-to-action were all then tailored towards convincing people to sign up for 
                        early access to the app.
