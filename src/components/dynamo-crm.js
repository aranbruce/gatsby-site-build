            To ensure back-office efficiency and great customer service,we
            created our own internal software that managed customer interactions
            and data throughout the customer lifecycle.

            Our solution was tailored specifically to the mortgage process, with
            user permissions, case progression, and the information architecture
            created to the ensure we could progress mortgage applications
            quickly and compliantly.

            came to prioritising and executing on opportunities to automate many
            areas of our processes. This resulted in our daily operations
            running more efficiently whilst ensuring our different departments
