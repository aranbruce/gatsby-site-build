          <h5>An Elegant API Suite to Deliver Seamless Mortgage Journeys</h5>
          <p>
            Working with our customers, Koodoo created a suite of APIs which
            provide developers with the tools they need to create easy and
            accessible experiences for their users. Koodoo’s APIs are able to
            interrogate users’ credit files, and use the data they identify to
            suggest mortgage products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Koodoo’s API-first services also monitor the mortgage market each
            day, and notify our partners when their users can save by
            remortgaging. We then send mortgage product data to our partners,
            enabling them to deliver highly personalised email campaigns to
            their users.
