            Understanding Audience Objectives to inform the New Website

          <p>
            With Certius looking to extend its services it offered, increase its
            digital presence and improve its lead generation, the decision was
            taken to relaunch the website based upon defined audience segments
            and key business objectives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through workshops with Certius and a thorough analysis of similar
            and competing businesses, both in Iran and abroad, primary
            objectives were established for each of the key audience segments.
            This then informed the information architecture, user flow and page
            structure that the new site would need to follow.
